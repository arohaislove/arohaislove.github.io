                    <p>Before we dive into our key messages, here are some words to avoid in Coastguard communications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Avoid technical jargon</strong> unless you're certain your audience will understand it. Instead of weather warning terms like gale or storm, use relatable language like "choppy seas" or more general but accessible terms like "challenging conditions" or "risky weather".</p>
                    <p><strong>Avoid the word "victim"</strong> as in "The victim was located by Coastguard volunteers near the rocks." Instead, use "person" or "individual".</p>
                    <p><strong>Avoid "Volunteer Members"</strong>. Drop "members" and simply say "volunteers".</p>

                    <p>Here are key messages about who Coastguard is and what we do. Use these in your communications.</p>
                    <p>Coastguard is Aotearoa New Zealand's primary marine safety, rescue, and education organisation. Over 2,000 passionate volunteers give their all to save lives on the water.</p>
                    <p>Our vision is that with our support everyone can enjoy Aotearoa New Zealand's waters safely and with confidence.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're a seasoned boatie, a kayak enthusiast, jet skier, or enjoy paddleboarding and more, Coastguard is here for you. We're all about supporting every water lover, no matter your waka.</p>
                    <p>We're the people you can turn to for help, big or small, for help, advice, or assistance. We're with you on and off the water. It's what we do.</p>
                    <p>Our incredible volunteers give up their time to train to ensure they're ready to put their skills into action when Kiwis need them the most.</p>
                    <p>We're not here to measure the size of your fish. Not to search your boat. And definitely not to judge your trailer backing skills. All we're here to do is help. All we care about is keeping you safe. All we want is to see you out there, enjoying life on the water. Confident in your own abilities, confident in knowing we'll always have your back.</p>

                    <p>When talking about our funding and charity status, here's what to emphasise.</p>
                    <p>As a charity, we're reliant on the generosity of others. A big chunk of our operating income, 60 percent, comes from donations, lotteries, membership, sponsorship, and grants. The remaining 40 percent comes from central government funding, all of which is critical to delivering our search and rescue service.</p>
                    <p>With 63 units across the country, 104 rescue vessels to fuel and maintain, and over 2,000 volunteers to train and equip, it's no small feat. We rely on the generosity of Kiwis to support us.</p>

                    <p>Day in and day out, through a team of over 2,000 highly skilled and experienced volunteers. Yep, that's right, volunteers. People who love being out on the oceans, lakes and rivers of Aotearoa New Zealand, just like you.</p>
                    <p>Giving up their days, nights and weekends not to go fishing, but to put in the mahi to be ready for any emergency you and Tangaroa can throw at them.</p>
                    <p>Whether it's giving great advice before you head out or helping if you get in a spot of bother, we're side by side with you on the water, whatever your waka.</p>
                    <p>Our dedicated volunteers and staff are proudly on the water, in the sky, behind the radio, at our units, in our classrooms, and in our communities. Going above and beyond to help save lives on the water.</p>

You'll need one when you contact Coastguard Radio to log a trip report, and most importantly, it helps us find you faster if you need help. Your callsign stores key details like your boat's size, type, colour, safety equipment, and emergency contacts, so we know exactly what to look for and who to notify. In Aotearoa New Zealand, you're legally required to use a Callsign when operating a Maritime VHF Radio. And for just $60, it's yours for life!</p>

                    <p>When talking about our volunteers and volunteering opportunities.</p>
                    <p>We're powered by over 2,000 highly trained and skilled volunteers, all passionate about saving lives on the water. They're here to help every water-loving Kiwi, whatever their waka.</p>
                    <p>Our volunteers embody compassion and camaraderie, giving up their time away from home or work to lend a helping hand when it's needed.</p>
                    <p>Across diverse roles, backgrounds, and communities, our volunteers come together as one inclusive whānau, reflecting the Aotearoa we know and love.</p>
                    <p>Volunteering for Coastguard is more than just our on-water capability. We have amazing shore crews from our radio operators to training coordinators whose teamwork enable us to bring people home safely.</p>
                    <p>Wāhine, or women, make up 20% of our 2,000 plus strong volunteer crew.</p>
                    <p>You don't have to be a boatie or even love the water to volunteer. All the training you need is provided and there are heaps of ways you can contribute without setting foot on a rescue vessel. Whether it's on the water or in the back room, there's a role with your name on it.</p>
                    <p>At Coastguard, volunteers are the heartbeat of our organisation. Whether on the water or behind the scenes, every volunteer plays a crucial role in keeping New Zealand's water-loving community safe. No matter how much time you can give, or where your skills lie, there's a place for you in our crew.</p>

                    <p>Here are top tips for incorporating te reo Māori into your communications.</p>
                    <p>Everyone is on their own journey when it comes to use and inclusion of Māori words and phrases. You don't have to use any te reo Māori if you don't want to. But, if you're keen to include a few kupu, or words, into your every day, here are some tips.</p>
                    <p><strong>Macrons.</strong> Macrons are used in te reo Māori to indicate the correct pronunciation of a vowel which has a lengthened sound. It's important to use macrons correctly. Missing a macron off a word is like spelling a word wrong. And if a macron is used on the wrong letters, it can change the meaning of a word altogether.</p>
                    <p><strong>Avoid the letter S.</strong> The letter 's' isn't in the Māori alphabet, so don't add it to make words plural. For example, don't write "Māoris" or "taongas".</p>
                    <p><strong>Put Te Reo Māori first.</strong> When using both Te Reo Māori and English, try to put the Māori word first, then the English. For example, Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to refer to Aotearoa New Zealand.</strong> Use Aotearoa New Zealand in full the first time you mention it, then use Aotearoa alone every other time. Feel free to use either term depending on the context and your preference. A mix of both is perfectly fine.</p>
                    <p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> Choose a few words or phrases you'd like to incorporate and work to include them in ways that make sense for your content and audience. It's best to start slow and become proficient at using a few words well.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ask for help.</strong> Our Kaihautū Māori is here to support and advise on the use and inclusion of te reo Māori, should you need it.</p>

                    <p>Here are special te reo Māori terms relevant to Coastguard.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tautiaki Moana</strong> is our ingoa, our name. Tautiaki Moana isn't a literal translation of Coastguard. Instead, it explains what we do on and off the water. Tautiaki means guard, guardian, and care. Moana means ocean, large lake, or body of water. Together, Tautiaki Moana speaks to the support, guidance, education and care, we provide for boaties on lakes, rivers, and oceans around the country. We are Coastguard Tautiaki Moana, Coastguard for short.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tangaroa</strong> is the god of the sea and all the creatures that live there. He is one of the many sons of Papatūānuku and Ranginui, the sky father and earth mother. Example: Our volunteers give up their days, nights and weekends not to go fishing, but to put in the mahi to be ready for any emergency you and Tangaroa can throw at them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Taonga</strong> means treasure, or anything considered to be of value. When referring to our name Tautiaki Moana: This precious taonga was gifted to us by Te Arawa Iwi in 2021.</p>
                    <p><strong>Te Ao Māori</strong> means the Māori worldview. Coastguard is on a journey to better understand and reflect Te Ao Māori.</p>
